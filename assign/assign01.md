title: "Assignment 1: Project Proposal"

**Due: Friday, Jan 29th by 11:59 PM**

This is a **Team** assignment.

Project Proposal
================

Your main task this semester is to complete a semester-long team software project. Your task in this assignment is to form your team and decide what your project will be.

In a 2-3 page document, describe the following:

**Who are your team members?** You must have at least 2 but not more than 4.

**Briefly describe the system your team will create.** Please note the following important requirements:

1.  The system must be a web application, meaning that the user interface must be web-based.
2.  The system must store persistent data in a database.
3.  The system must be awesome when it is completed.

*Be ambitious*. The goal of this course is to learn how to design and build complex software. I do not expect that you will necessarily complete 100% of what you propose.

In your description of the system, include sketches of what the user interface will look like.

**What language(s) and programming environment will you use?** My **strong** recommendation is to use Java and Eclipse, using Java servlets and Java Server Pages (JSPs).  I also strongly recommend that you do **not** use client-side JavaScript. Also do **not** try to implement a game, as previous history has shown that game development for this class has a low-rate (5%) of success.

I **strongly** recommend that you discuss your idea with me before you submit your proposal.

Here is a suggested template for your [Group Project Proposal](CS320_Group_Project_Proposal_Template.pdf).

Submitting
==========

Have one team member create a  folder in Google Drive named "CS320-TeamProject-www-xxx-yyy-zzz", replacing "www-xxx-yyy-zzz" with the YCP User IDs of the members of your project team.

Then create your Project Proposal in that folder, using Google Docs.  Share the folder with all team members and with me.

This folder will be your means of submission for all **non-programming-related team** assignments.

Name your Project Proposal document **assign01-www-xxx-yyy-zzz**, again substituting the YCP User IDs of your project team members.

title: "Assignment 2: Individual Project Proposal"
---

**Due: Friday, Feb 5th by 11:59 PM**

This is an **Individual** assignment.

Individual Project
==================

Software development is a vast and rapidly-changing field.
Almost any substantial project will require you to learn about
new technologies, which could include programming languages,
libraries, databases, etc.  Being able to learn
new technologies on your own
and use them effectively in a project is an essential skill
for a software developer.

Your task in this assignment is to propose an individual project
you will work on this semester that involves one or more technologies
related to software development that will be a new learning experience
for you.

Some possible examples:

* Learn a new programming language (E.g., Clojure, Scala, Erlang)
  and write a nontrivial program in that language
* Learn about Javascript and AJAX for rich web client interfaces,
  develop a web application
* Learn about programming embedded systems and hardware interfacing
  (e.g., AVR, Arduino), use it in a hardware project (a data logger,
  robot, etc.)

These are just examples: I encourage you to be creative and
think of something that interests you personally.  The most important
requirement is that you should learn something new!

Scope
-----

The project should be smaller in scope than your team project:
the purpose is more to learn something new than to create a substantial
software system.  However, your project must be nontrivial: the
system you create should do something interesting.

Proposal Format
===============

Your proposal should be 1-2 pages, and contain the following information:

* Description of your project
* List one or more technologies related to software development that you
  will learn about
* Briefly discuss your plan for the project: list what sources of information
  you plan to use, and provide a list of steps/intermediate goals that
  will allow you to make progress towards completing the project.  You
  have until the end of the semester to complete the project, but keep
  in mind that I expect you to make steady progress, and that there will
  be occasional progress reports/demos.
  
  Here is a suggested template for your [Independent Project Proposal](CS320_Independent_Project_Proposal_Template.pdf).

Submitting
==========

Create a folder in Google Drive named "CS320-IndProject-userID", replacing "userID" with your YCP User ID.

Then create your Project Proposal in that folder, using Google Docs.  Share the folder and its contents with me.

This folder will be your means of submission for all non-programming-related individual assignments.

Name your Project Proposal document **assign02-userID**, again substituting your YCP User ID.

<b>Important</b>: Only submissions in Google Docs will be accepted.
Do not submit a document in any other format!
